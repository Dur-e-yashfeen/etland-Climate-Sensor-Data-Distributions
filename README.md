# 🌍 Quick Visual Analyzer for Wetland & Climate Sensor Data Distributions

### Overview
This repository provides an **offline, lightweight Jupyter Notebook** designed for rapid visualization and summary of **temperature and humidity distributions** recorded by environmental or wetland sensors.

It also supports analysis of historical **climate temperature datasets** (such as the Berkeley Earth dataset from Kaggle) — offering the same visual workflow to study long-term temperature trends.

---

### 🔧 Features
- 📂 **Offline operation** — no internet or cloud dependencies.  
- 📊 **Automatic visualization** — histograms and boxplots for temperature and humidity.  
- 🧮 **Descriptive statistics** — mean, median, quartiles, IQR, and outlier detection.  
- 🧠 **Explanatory markdown** — contextual interpretations included in the notebook.  
- 🧱 **Sample embedded dataset** — runs instantly even without a CSV file.

---

### 📘 Notebook
**File:** `wetland_sensor_analyzer.ipynb`

This notebook can handle:
- Local wetland sensor CSVs:  
  `timestamp, temperature_C, humidity_pct`
- Kaggle datasets such as:  
  `/kaggle/input/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/GlobalTemperatures.csv`

---

### ⚙️ How to Run

#### 1. Requirements
Install dependencies (standard Python scientific stack):
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
````

#### 2. Run Locally

```bash
jupyter notebook wetland_sensor_analyzer.ipynb
```

#### 3. (Optional) Run on Kaggle

* Upload or reference datasets under `/kaggle/input/`
* Modify the `csv_path` variable in the first code cell to match your desired file.

### 📊 Output Samples

**Generated by the notebook:**

* Histogram — Temperature distribution
* Boxplot — Temperature outliers
* Summary statistics table

Each visualization includes labeled axes and descriptive captions.

---

### 🧠 Interpretation

The notebook contextualizes every figure:

* Temperature histograms show overall spread and central tendency.
* Boxplots highlight variability and outliers.
* Statistical summaries support quick anomaly checks.

---

### 🧪 Example Applications

* Rapid field QA of wetland sensor data (offline).
* Historical climate change visualization (Berkeley Earth datasets).
* Teaching tool for environmental data analysis.
